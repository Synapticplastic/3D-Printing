These are .STL files which can be freely 3D printed for advancement of TUS neuromodulation research

The first file adapts a 10mm-thick ultrasound transducer of diameter 38mm to the underside of a Magstim 70mm figure 8 TMS coil.
Depending on the diameter and thickness of the transducer, and the topology of the TMS coil used, the design may need to be modified.
The second file is a transducer-only holder, with built-in slits for velcro straps for easy attachment to the subject's head.

3D Printing Suggestions: Black PLA filament, 0.2mm layers, Enable Supports, No raft, Infill >40%
