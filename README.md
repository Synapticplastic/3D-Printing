Fomenko et al. manuscript (under review) models for 3D printing

These are STL files which can be freely 3D printed for the purpose of replicating experiments in the publication 
Fomenko et al. 2019 "Parametric effects of transcranial low-intensity ultrasound on human motor cortex excitability and behaviour".

The first file adapts a FUS transducer to the underside of a standard 70mm figure 8 TMS coil
The second file adapts a FUS transducer alone the scalp, with slits for velcro straps
