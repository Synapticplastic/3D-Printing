These are .STL files, originally designed on Autodesk Fusion 360, which can be freely modified and 3D printed for advancement of TUS neuromodulation research.

The first file adapts a 10mm-thick ultrasound transducer of diameter 38mm to the underside of a Magstim 70mm figure 8 TMS coil. Since transducer and TMS coil dimensions vary, the design may need to be modified accordingly. The second file is a transducer-only holder, with built-in slits for velcro straps for easy attachment to the subject's head.

3D Printing Suggestions: Black PLA filament, 0.2mm layers, Enable Supports, No raft, Infill >40%
