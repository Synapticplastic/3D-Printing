These are STL files which can be freely 3D printed for advancement of TUS neuromodulation research

The first file adapts a TUS transducer to the underside of a standard 70mm figure 8 TMS coil.
Depending on the diameter and thickness of the transducer, this may need to be modified
The second file adapts a FUS transducer alone the scalp, with slits for velcro straps
